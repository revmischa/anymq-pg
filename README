NAME
    AnyMQ::Pg - Use built-in PostgreSQL 'LISTEN' and 'NOTIFY' commands for
    message-passing.

ABOUT
    Enables the use of PostgreSQL as a backend for message queueing
    functionality.

    Most people are probably unaware that PostgreSQL has a built-in
    asynchronous publish/subscribe mechanism, but it does. Check it out:

          on_connect => sub { ... },
